# Snap It

## Description

Snap It is a user-friendly app designed to help individuals cope with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) by engaging in a visual journaling process. The app prompts users to take a photo based on random prompts and encourages them to write a comment to capture their mood alongside the image. MoodSnap then analyzes the user's mood based on their text input using sentiment analysis techniques. By visually documenting their emotions and thoughts, users can gain insights into their mood patterns over time and take proactive steps to manage their mental well-being.

3. **Commentary:** After capturing the image, users are prompted to write a brief comment or description capturing their mood, thoughts, or feelings in that moment.
